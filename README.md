# x100pre--v3.0
x100pre Records is an ecommerce store that is used to sell vinyls and vinyl players. This is version two of this website but for this version React was implemented, a node server, and a mysql database to render the products.

# Using and Running 
In order to begin using x100pre Records.... Download the repo to your local machine. Delete all the "package-lock.json" files. Next, open a terminal and go to the server directory(cd server) and do a npm install. Open another terminal and go to the client directory (cd client) and do a npm install.

To get the website running You will open a terminal for your server (cd server) and then npm start. And open another terminal for your client folder (cd client) and do another npm start. If you accidently kill ther terminal this is how you would get the app up and running again.

MYSQL data is currently running on a ec2 instance that is located in 'http://3.137.215.130:5000/products'
That is how the products are being rendered.

# Stopping 
To Stop the app from working all you wanna do is either kill the terminal or open a terminal for your client folder (cd client) and in the terminal you can do "ctrl" and "C" at the same time on your keyboard to stop the react app from running.
